# A Collection of Catppuccin Mocha Wallpapers

> Disclaimer: These wallpapers are sourced from many, many, many sources on the internet. I did not make any of these, although I have *edited* several of them a little bit and use lutgen to convert them from their normal versions to the catppuccin-mocha colour scheme. Zero credit belongs to me in that regard, I'm simply the collector. If you are the artist of one of these wallpapers, please [**contact me**] via raising an issue on this repository, I will happily take the wallpaper down or add credit in this README.
